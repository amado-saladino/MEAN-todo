# TODO
MEAN stack application with Angular and Nodejs

This demo explains how to build TODO:
- Angular
- REST api server using express nodejs
- Bootswatch theme for bootstrap

To run locally, go to project folder and run this command:
```sh
node server.js
```

If you need to build Angular app, go to folder <client> within the project folder and run this command:

```sh
ng build
```
This will generate a new folder <dist> inside Angular app folder, copy the contents of this folder to the folder <public> within MEAN project folder

Good luck
